# 💧 Water Resource Management and Potability Analysis  

## 📌 Project Title  
**Water Resource Management and Sustainable Usage Analysis**  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Water scarcity is becoming a critical global issue, with increasing demand from agriculture, industry, and domestic use. Efficient water resource management can help optimize usage, reduce waste, and ensure equitable distribution across regions. This project analyzes **water quality and potability** data, performs cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection to understand which water characteristics affect safety for human consumption.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess raw water quality data.  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Apply transformations and scaling for model readiness.  
- Conduct feature selection to identify the most important factors influencing potability.  
- Build a foundation for predictive modeling in later weeks.

## 📂 Dataset  
File: **`water_potability.csv`**  

### Columns:  
- **ph** – Acidity/alkalinity level of water  
- **Hardness** – Calcium & magnesium concentration  
- **Solids** – Total dissolved solids in ppm  
- **Chloramines** – Amount of chloramines in ppm  
- **Sulfate** – Sulfate concentration in mg/L  
- **Conductivity** – Electrical conductivity in μS/cm  
- **Organic_carbon** – Organic carbon in ppm  
- **Trihalomethanes** – Concentration of THMs in μg/L  
- **Turbidity** – Water clarity  
- **Potability** – Target variable (1 = Safe, 0 = Not Safe)

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  

### 🔹 Week 1 – Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values (`ph`, `Sulfate`, `Trihalomethanes`) using **median imputation**.  
- Replaced unrealistic values (`ph = 0`) with NaN before imputation.  
- Verified cleaned dataset with updated statistics.  

### 🔹 Week 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Transformation & Feature Selection  
- Visualized distributions of features (histograms, boxplots).  
- Checked correlation using heatmaps.  
- Scaled features using **StandardScaler**.  
- Selected key features using **correlation analysis** and **Random Forest feature importance**.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Certain water quality parameters (e.g., **pH, Sulfate, Trihalomethanes**) strongly influence **Potability**.  
- Outliers exist in parameters like **Solids** and **Hardness**, requiring careful preprocessing.  
- Feature importance analysis shows which variables matter most for safe drinking water classification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Scaling & Feature Selection  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3 and Beyond)  
- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.  
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
- Deploy model as a simple web application.
